## SPOT: Secure and Privacy-preserving prOximiTy protocol for e-healthcare systems

This repository contains the proof-of-concept functionality of SPOT, a novel hybrid secure and privacy-preserving proximity-based protocol for e-healthcare systems, that combines a decentralized proxy frontend architecture and a centralized backend computing server. On the one hand, it ensures users' privacy while remaining anonymous and unlinkable over multiple sessions. On the other hand, SPOT guarantees the correctness of contact information while preventing the generation of false positives.
The reference paper of this solution will be available soon.

The POC of SPOT relies in part on the implementation of Groth-Sahai proofs given [here](https://github.com/gijsvl/groth-sahai).
